# LOREM-JAX

## Installing the i-PI driver

After installation of the package install the i-PI driver via

```bash
loremjax-install-ipi-driver
```

The installation script will hotfix the i-PI installation by performing the following steps copying the LOREM driver into the i-PI `pes` directory. You can rerun `loremjax-install-ipi-driver` anytime (it is idempotent) if you switch environments or reinstall i-PI.
